# VOICEVOX TTS Integration for Home Assistant
**English** | [日本語](docs/README-ja.md)

This custom integration provides Japanese TTS services using [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) in Home Assistant.

>[!NOTE]
>To use VOICEVOX TTS, you need a server running [VOICEVOX Engine](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_engine).
>
>[VOICEVOX Engine Addon](https://github.com/taikun114/Home-Assistant-VOICEVOX-Engine) is also available and can be used.

When using VOICEVOX TTS, please be sure to read [VOICEVOX's Terms of Use](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/term/) and each character's Terms of Use.

>[!NOTE]
>I have confirmed that the Japanese TTS engine [AivisSpeech Engine](https://github.com/Aivis-Project/AivisSpeech-Engine), which is compatible with the VOICEVOX API, can also be used without any problems.
>
>If you want to use it with AivisSpeech Engine, please enter the host and port of the server running the AivisSpeech Engine when setting up the VOICEVOX TTS integration.

## Install
### Via HACS
